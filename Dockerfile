# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the /app directory
# The package.json file contains the list of dependencies that need to be installed for the app to run.
# This command will copy the package.json and package-lock.json files from the current directory to the /app directory in the container.
# This is done before copying the rest of the files to take advantage of Dockerâ€™s layer caching mechanism.
# If the package.json and package-lock.json files have not changed, Docker will use the cached layer for this step, which will speed up the build process.
